It's a personal finance budget calculator that does all the math for you, including an estimate of your taxes owed.

Backstory: I was inspired to make this after seeing several friends trying to take control of their finances and make a budget, but becoming confused and frustrated by some of the complicated math related to pre-tax vs post-tax savings/expenses and taxes.

Single Page Application (SPA) made with Angular + .Net Core.
